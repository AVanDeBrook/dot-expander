# About
This is a companion project to phxBMS. 

It reads the dot files created by the project's documentation and creates a representation of them in memory. 
Then, it will rewrite the dot files in a format that makes it easier to tell which functions are interacting with each other, so we can hopefully minimize the use of global functions and other unnecessary variables/functions.
